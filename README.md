## Projects
### Pokedex App
Together with my best friend, I embarked on an exciting project to build a comprehensive Pokedex app. This application is a testament to our shared passion for coding and the world of Pok√©mon. Here's a quick overview:

- **Tech Stack:** React-Vite and Java with Spring Boot
- **Features:**
  - Utilizes the Pok√©mon API to fetch and display a wide range of Pok√©mon data.
  - User-friendly interface designed with React-Vite, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.
  - Robust backend developed in Java with Spring Boot, ensuring efficient data handling and API integration.
- **Role:** My main contributions were in backend development, focusing on API integration and data management with Java and Spring Boot. I also collaborated on the frontend development, working with React-Vite to bring our vision to life.
- **GitHub Repository:** [Pokedex App Repository](#) _(https://github.com/mauri276/ReactSpring-Pokemon-App)_
### Social Media App: Backend Development with Node.js, MongoDB, and ExpressJS
I developed the backend for a social app similar to Twitter, using Node.js, MongoDB, and ExpressJS. This project was an exciting journey into creating scalable, efficient back-end systems for social media applications. The key features of this backend include:

- **Real-Time Interactions:** Leveraging Node.js for its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, enabling real-time updates and interactions.
- **Database Management:** Utilizing MongoDB for flexible, scalable database solutions, perfectly suited for handling large volumes of unstructured data.
- **API Development:** Crafting robust APIs with ExpressJS to handle various requests efficiently and securely.
